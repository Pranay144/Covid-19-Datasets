Positive COVID-19 CT scans from the American Hospital of Paris

The `Anonymized` and `Thorax` folders contain DICOM images (`.dcm` file extension). This is a complex, highly dimensional file format.

There are many softwares for Windows and MAC which open `.dcm` extension files.

The files in all other folders have no file extension at this time. Probably they should have `dcm` extension.

Beware, the whole files are over 1.3 GB.
