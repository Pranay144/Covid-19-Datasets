## Organization

The `Anonymized` and `Thorax` folders contain DICOM images (`dcm` file extension). This is a complex, highly dimensional file format.

There are many softwares for windows and mac which open .dcm extension files.

The files in all other folders have no file extension at this time. Probably they should have `dcm` extension.

Beware, the whole files are over 1.3 GB.
