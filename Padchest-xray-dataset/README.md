# COVID-19-Dataset
## Note: please do not claim diagnostic performance of a model without a clinical study. This is basically for research purpose.

Combination of data from the PadChest dataset and with other datasets based on COVID-19 pathology to provide the open scientific community with data of clinical-scientific value that helps early detection of COVID-19.


Collection of chest X-ray images data that will be used to training Deep Learning (DL) models. Such training is meant to obtain an early detection of infection and pneumonia by Covid from a simple chest X-ray. 
In order to achieve this, these images will be structured into subgroups of images coming from the PadChest dataset with differential diagnosis related to COVID-19’s radiological semiology, allowing to develop the first models based on Artificial Intelligence to better predict and understand the infection. 


Contribution is open for anyone, extracting new COVID-19’s X-ray data set from clinical authorities. The dataset should be  distinguishable and related to COVID-19's pathology course (pneumonia, infiltrated and controls)

Preprocessing is basically, the images are gonna be stored both in cluster and Kaggle and distributed into three groups: training or (Tr) 60%, validation or (Val) 20% and test or (Te) 20%. 

Various models will be trained and the ones which obtain better accuracy will be available as open source code in order to when a large new COVID-19 data set is acquired, enable Transfer-Learning in new computational models.
